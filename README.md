# DaisyDescriptors
Experiment with the daisy function in scikit-image

This edited code came from a PluralSight course by Janani Ravi.
The course is: 
Building Image Processing Applications Using scikit-image

The idea was to experiment with the arguments and display results.
The approach is quite basic. This is just an introduction to
the topic.

If interested in addditional comments, I invite you to read the

Remember that one of the best ways to lear is to read, experiment,
and repeat.

Enjoy,
